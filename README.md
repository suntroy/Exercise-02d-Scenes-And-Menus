# Exercise-02d-Scenes-And-Menus

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A basic space-shooter arcade game, created in Unity.

## Implementation

Created using [Unity 2022.3.17f1](https://unity.com/download)

Assets are provided by [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-extension), provided under a [CC0 1.0 Public Domain License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

The explosion spritesheet was released into the public domain by [StumpyStrust](https://opengameart.org/content/explosion-sheet). 

The explosion sound effect was made by Roblox. The audio was taken by BluePrismatic's "Roblox Explosion Sound Effect" video on Youtube. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2A43FW0fb4)

The 'pew' sound effect was clipped from freesound_community's "Pew Pew Pew with a Gun" from Pixabay.

The man screaming sound effect was clipped from Universfield's "Man Scream 08" from Pixabay.

The music on the start menu was made by FineTune Music on Adobe Stock. (https://stock.adobe.com/search/audio?k=1677646128) 

All art assets, including the background image, were made by Sunny Troyer. 

On top of the features implemented through Exercises 2a-d, I added original art assets (made through Pixilart) and a background image for all the scenes. I also added sound effects for whenever the player fires a bullet, whenever a GameObject explodes, and when the player dies and is sent to the Game Over screen. I added background music for the start menu, as the background music and sound effects would have clashed if combined together. With all these additions (+2 for original assets, +1 for BG image, +1 for sound effects, +1 for music), I'd expect a 20/20 on the assignment. 

I hope you enjoy what I came up with. Making assets and finding silly sound effects was some of the most fun I've had in the class yet!

## Future Development
If I choose to refine this project in the future, I'd like to add more nonsensical enemies and other scoring options, with more stages (and sillier sounds).
